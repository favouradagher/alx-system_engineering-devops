My First Postmortem
          What Happened:
  
           Impact:

The login service stopped working.
About 20% of our users couldn't log in.
Why It Happened:
There was a mistake in how we set up the login system.

What We Did:
Found the Issue: Our monitoring system noticed lots of login failures.

Investigation: Looked at the logs to figure out what went wrong.

Initial Guess: Thought it might be a hacker or a problem with the software update.

Got Help: Asked our security team to check things out.

Mistakes We Made:

Thought it was a software update problem at first.
Checked the database even though it wasn't the issue.
Asked for Help:

Brought in the DevOps and Security teams to help.
Fixed the Issue:

Discovered it was a setup mistake.
Went back to the way things were before the mistake.
Added extra security to prevent it from happening again.
What We Learned:
Why it Broke:
There was a mix-up when we changed something in the login system.

How We Fixed It:
We went back to how it was before the change, and we added extra security.

How We'll Avoid This Next Time:
Things to Make Better:

Test changes better before making them live.
Keep a closer eye on unusual login patterns.
To-Do List:

Check changes more carefully before putting them live.
Improve the tools that watch for weird login patterns.
Be more careful with how we set up things in the future.
